Choose a car make/model + maybe additional parameters
Two possible sources of data:
1) auto.ria.ua				
2) ebay motors				

Build 3 scatter plots with regression curves:
a) price/age [1, 2]				
b) price/mileage [1]				
c) age/mileage (unfortunately for Ukraine mileage parameter is likely to be false :( ) [1]				

Source [1] says that for a) and c) there might be a linear dependance, for b) - an exponential dependance.
Source [2] says that price and age have exponential dependance with price going to some minimum level (in 10-14 years) which depends on the model.

common sense dictates that price and mileage/age should have something close to exponential dependance (in a reasonable range of age/mileage).

User can then enter age/mileage[/price] of his/her car and check how they meet with the general picture.

Extra: we can extrapolate curves to predict car price change in X years.

Calculations can be made either dynamically (but that will probably be quite long) or ahead, periodically (for eg., monthly).
