# car-price-age-mileage
This is my 1st real project when learning to code.

Task: to create a web-service where a user can enter a car make/model and get 3 charts of correlation of it's 
a) age/price, b) mileage/price and c) age/mileage.

Data will be taken from auto.ria.ua (the biggest Ukrainian advertisement board where, as they claim, '1400 cars are sold daily'
using their API (https://github.com/ria-com/auto-ria-rest-api) (alternatively - from eBay Motors using eBay Finding API, 
https://developer.ebay.com/Devzone/finding/Concepts/FindingAPIGuide.html)
